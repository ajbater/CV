## Amanda Bater

I've spent the last 6 years working as a designer in the fashion industry, and have recently left this behind to pursue a career in web development. Learning to code has reignited my love of learning, creativy and problem solving. I hope to find a job where I can continue to feel challenged and excited every day, and work with like-minded people creating awesome things!

## Skills

#### Creativity

Working as a designer for the last 6 years has given me the the chance to utilise my creativity on a daily basis. In my last role I spent most of my time working directly with clients, being briefed on their needs and carrying out design work in response to this. I recognise that creativity is often a collaborative process and have enjoyed working closely with clients and other members of my team.
