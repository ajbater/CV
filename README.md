## Amanda Bater

I am a full stack junior developer and new graduate of Makers Academy, a highly selective web development bootcamp.
Prior to this I worked as a designer in the fashion industry, and have worked with both small studios and large retailers. I found myself seeking a change in direction, and found that coding reignited my love of learning, creativity, and designing well crafted solutions to problems.
My time at Makers Academy has instilled in me a passion for writing clean, extendable, well-tested code. I'm currently seeking my first role as a junior developer, and I'm looking forward to joining a team where I am given the opportunity and support to continue this fast pace of learning.

## Skills

#### Creativity

Working as a designer for the last 6 years gave me the the chance to utilise my creative skills on a daily basis. In my last role I spent a great deal of time working directly with clients, being briefed on their needs and carrying out design work in response to this. I recognise that creativity is often a collaborative process and have enjoyed working closely with clients and other members of my team. I feel strongly that creativity is also a very important aspect of coding - I love the thrill of creating something from nothing and the challenge of designing a well-thought-out solution that adheres to the best practises that I have learnt.

#### Communication

The time I spent at my last job liaising between clients, team members and manufacturers helped me to gain excellent communication skills. These skills have developed further still during my time at Makers Academy as such emphasis is placed upon pairing and teamwork. I really enjoy working with others, both in pairing situations and in groups that I have been a part of.

#### Good under pressure

I have lots of experience with working to tight deadlines, and carrying out important tasks at very short notice. My organisational skills allow me to confidently prioritise my workload to ensure I am able to deliver the best possible product within the given timeframe.

#### Technical Skills

Ruby, Rails, Sinatra, JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, React.js, PostgreSQL, HTML, CSS.

I'm also highly capably with Adobe Suite software, especially Photoshop.
